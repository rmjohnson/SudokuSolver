Sudoku Solver
=============

This is a sudoku solver. It was originally created in order to learn WPF and C# in preparation for my internship at Logos this summer.

It works for moderate level sudoku puzzles but there are still some strategies that need to be implemented in order to solve harder puzzles.

* Make one number at a time work
* Make impossible to solve puzzles be flagged as such instead of "forcing" them to work (changing original numbers)
* Implement additional solving strategies
* Optimize
